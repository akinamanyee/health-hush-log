# Product Roadmap — 健康紀錄簿

Ordered so the product is genuinely usable at the end of every milestone. Each milestone is one slice of the magic, traceable to the PRD; the HOW lives in the per-milestone build plan under [plan/](plan/).

**Status (2026-09-16 23:08 HKT):** M1–M8 delivered and verified — build plan
[plan/01-08-initial-build.md](plan/01-08-initial-build.md), followed by
[plan/09-prd-reconciliation.md](plan/09-prd-reconciliation.md). New milestones slot in below,
never replacing this sequence.

## M1 — A calm home worth returning to
The Traditional Chinese, 50+ friendly shell: the Japanese-minimalist glass-and-earth-tone design system, the dashboard with four clearly labelled module cards (體脂、血壓、握力、坐位體前彎), the standing 「資料只存在此裝置」 privacy notice, and the 「僅供參考，不能取代醫生診斷」 disclaimer. Value: a visitor immediately understands what this is, trusts it, and can navigate without reading instructions.
Traces: USER · Visual Design System · HARD CONSTRAINTS (privacy, disclaimer).

## M2 — 血壓紀錄: your first trustworthy logbook
Blood-pressure entry by typing, instant grading against the reference chart (including the worse-of-two rule that surfaces isolated systolic hypertension), and local history with a trend view. Value: a real, working logbook for the most-watched metric of this audience — usable product from here on.
Traces: USER JOURNEY 2–3 (manual input path) · Blood Pressure module · Data Portability (local history).

## M3 — 複查日曆: never wonder when to re-check
The re-check date computed from the tier (6 months / 1 year / 2 years; crisis-level readings show 「即時就醫」 instead), with a one-tap downloadable calendar file and a Google Calendar link. Value: the app turns a grade into an action, closing the loop on blood pressure.
Traces: Calendar Synchronization · SUCCESS (the .ics moment).

## M4 — 全部四個模組: every check, one book
Grip strength and sit-and-reach join Tanita body composition as typed-entry modules with age- and gender-matched grading, honest 「無適用參考標準」 when a chart doesn't cover the user, and a trend history each. Value: all four readings live in one place with the same familiar flow.
Traces: The Four Core Health Modules · HARD CONSTRAINTS (deterministic grading).

## M5 — 影相即記: readings from a photo
Drag-and-drop a photo of the Tanita screen or monitor; the reading is read by the server-side AI and lands in an editable review form, confirmed before it saves — with honest Chinese errors and an empty-field fallback, never guesses. Includes the daily AI-usage cap message. Value: the signature moment — paper logbook habits with zero typing.
Traces: Multimodal Input · Secure Backend Integration · SUCCESS · HARD CONSTRAINTS (key server-side, nothing persisted).

## M6 — 講出嚟都得: voice dictation
A microphone button on the same forms where the browser supports Chinese dictation; spoken numbers land in the same review-and-confirm flow. Value: the fastest, most accessible input for the 50+ user who types slowly.
Traces: Multimodal Input (microphone button) · capability-gated per investigation.

## M7 — 帶得走的數據: CSV export
One-click export of the full history in Excel-friendly Traditional Chinese CSV, plus the deliberate clear-all action. Value: true local-first ownership — data is portable and erasable by the user alone.
Traces: Data Portability · HARD CONSTRAINTS (local-only, clear-all).

## M8 — 健康摘要: grounded advice, never invented
The reporting section: a plain-language health summary generated strictly from the bundled reference leaflets, declining anything outside them, failing visibly rather than hallucinating. Value: the calm, safe voice that interprets the four modules without ever playing doctor.
Traces: Grounded AI Advice · HARD CONSTRAINTS (grounding, disclaimer).

Each milestone ends with a live, usable product: M1 is a shell you can look at, M2 a working logbook, and every later step adds magic without breaking what's there.
